# FocusApp

This page implements a Modal box using CSS and JS that allows our buttons to show a popup dialag box. 

I also used a form which uses JS that adds task which submission can then be added into a to do list. You can mark a task as completed and be able to track what you did. 

This page also uses local storage to keep track of each task inserted and even saves whether it was marked as completed or not which reflects on the page (either crosses it out or remove it from the list completely).
